Running
-------
The live data prototype consists of several python scripts that run independently (and communicate via ZeroMQ). Certain aspects (typically parameters) of these components can be controlled via a ZeroMQ interface.

There are 4 main components that need to be started:

- Streamer (generates fake event data)
- Backend-live-listener (reads event stream, distributes it to all MPI ranks, and buffers event data)
- Backend-reducer (reads data from live-listener and runs Mantid-based data reduction)
- Visualizer (lightweight visualization of reduciton result)

The respective commands are:

**Streamer:**
```sh
python run_streamer.py
```

**Backend-live-listener:**
```sh
mpirun -n <N> python run_backend_event_listener.py
```
where `<N>` is the desired number of MPI ranks. `mpirun -n <N>` can be omitted to run only with a single process.

**Backend-reducer:**
```sh
mpirun -n <N> python run_backend_reducer.py
```
where `<N>` is the desired number of MPI ranks. It *must* match the number of ranks used for the backend-live-listener.

**Visualizer:**
```sh
python run_visualizer.py
# if running more than one gatherhistogram transition, another instance of the the visualizer will need to be run, and the port number the new visualizer is watching will need to be set as different:
python run_visualizer.py -p 10006 #or 10007 or 8 depending on how many gather_histograms are running 
```

In all four cases the run script supports the option `-h` to print help, and further options, as described in the respective help. In particular, in several cases you can set the log level with `-l` and the host with `-H` (which defaults to localhost).

**Control and the transition tree:**

...is possible with the script `control.py`.
 it is possible to add transitions to the workflow dynamically.
Usage example:
```sh
# Query server for current transition tree
python control.py -p 10005 -c BackendMantidReducer transition_tree
# This should print out a tree, initially containing only the MantidWorkspace, with an ID number
# Example of adding reduction transition to the workflow: 
python control.py -p 10005 -c BackendMantidReducer transition_tree '<parent transition ID>-Reduction'
```

A typical workflow would look something like this:
```sh
+-CreateMantidWorkspaceFromEventsTransition 140086180499600
 |
 +-ReductionTransition 140086197788496
 | |
 | +-MantidFilterTransition 140086180499728
 | | |
 | | +-MantidRebinTransition 140086180499856
 | | | |
 | | | +-GatherHistogramTransition 140086180501136
 | | |
 | | +-MantidRebinTransition 140086197787600
 
 ```

**Control while running:**

...again using the control.py script. The components described above listen for commands via ZeroMQ on various ports (streamer on 10002, backend-reducer on 10004 and 10005).

Usage example:
```sh
# Query server for available controllees and commands
python control.py -p <PORT>
# Example usage for setting the bin size for the selected backend-reducer
python control.py -p 10005 -c BackendMantidReducer bin_parameters '<transition ID>-0.4,0.001,5'
```


Running the unit tests
----------------------
```sh
python -m unittest discover tests
```
or for individual modules
```sh
python -m unittest discover tests.test_backend
```
